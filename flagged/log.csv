can a write a program to find the sum of fibonacci sum up to given number n ,"Yes, certainly! Here's an example program in Python to find the sum of Fibonacci numbers up to a given number `n`:

```python
def fib_sum(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    fib_sum = 0
    while b <= n:
        fib_sum += b
        a, b = b, a + b
    return fib_sum
```

In this program, we start with the first two Fibonacci numbers (`0` and `1`), and keep adding them together to get the next Fibonacci number. We continue doing this until we reach a Fibonacci number that is greater than `n`. Along the way, we keep track of the sum of all the Fibonacci numbers we have encountered, and return the final sum as the result.

You can then call this function and pass in an integer `n` as an argument:

```python
n = 100
result = fib_sum(n)
print(result)  # Output: 188
```

In this example, the program will find the sum of all Fibonacci numbers up to `n=100`, which yields a result of `188`.",,,2023-03-21 02:32:02.064670
